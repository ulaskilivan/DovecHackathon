Right in the middle of Famagusta&#39;s most well-known stores, brands and accessories, there is a lively living point with its corner stores, offices and residences.</p>\n\n<h2>Fantastic Investment Opportunity</h2>\n\n<p>The building, which is prepared to be an active living center that will fill its position with 11 large stores, offices, studio apartments, 1+1, 2+1 and 3+1 flats and penthouses, built on a 5000 square meter land, will consist of two blocks and terraced floors. . The project between the two main arteries of Famagusta is within walking distance of both streets and in the middle of the access roads. The project stands out as an ideal address for investment with its proximity to Ada Kent and Eastern Mediterranean University. The fact that the rent amounts in the Sakarya region are 20% higher than other regions, the annual cash payment and the increase in the value of the region provide great advantages for investors.</p>\n\n<h2>A New Concept for the Heart of the City Sky Sakarya</h2>\n\n<p>Composed of 11 shops and 139 flats in total, SKY Sakarya offers alternatives to meet all kinds of needs and flat size demands with studio, 1+1, 2+1 and 3+1 flats with large balconies and penthouse flats on terraced areas. At the same time, it creates a special option for changing working habits with the Home-Office concepts designed. The semi-enclosed mezzanine created under the high eaves in front of the shops on the ground floor will create an intermediate space in front of the shops, protected from rain and sun, and will help the commercial life to overflow here. It is already obvious that Sky Sakarya, which will rise right next to D\u00f6ve\u00e7 Group&#39;s award-winning projects Golden Residence and Terrace Park, will also be a candidate to win many awards.</p>",
